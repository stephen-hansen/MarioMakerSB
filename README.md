# MarioMakerSB
Clone of Mario Maker in Small Basic (VB clone) that I wrote for junior year (student-chosen final project). 

WARNING: VERY LAGGY AS SB IS A POOR LANGUAGE MEMORY-WISE.

Files are slightly unorganized, so here's a rundown of what almost everything is:
- sbs are the actual code files
- pdbs are, i don't even really know, but the compiler automatically creates them in runtime
- exes are the actual program files created by the compiler
- most of the graphics files are ripped from super mario maker on wii u, anything else is stuff i created in photoshop
- levels can be found in the "Levels" folder; they are sorted by user and are text that the game loads into level formats
- music is in the "Music" folder; contains mostly mega man and some secret cheat code tunes (think konami code)
- the "Users" folder contains User and Password data. the passwords are not encrypted, so this is a very bad implementation of login.

The game runs pretty well, albeit with a few bugs I never ironed out. Also, larger levels will lag a ton no matter how good your GPU is. Small Basic is just a garbage language. If someone converted this to VB it might run slightly better.
